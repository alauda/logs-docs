# Introduction

The platform's auditing function provides time-ordered operation records related to users and system security. This helps you analyze specific issues and quickly resolve problems that occur in clusters, custom applications, and other areas.

Through auditing, you can track various changes in the Kubernetes cluster, including:

* What changes occurred in the cluster during a specific time period
* Who performed these changes (system components or users)
* Details of important change events (e.g., POD parameter updates)
* Event outcomes (success or failure)
* Operator location (internal or external to the cluster)
* User operation records (updates, deletions, management operations) and their results

## Prerequisites

Your account must have platform management or platform auditing permissions.

## Procedure

1. In the left navigation bar, click **Auditing**.

2. Select the auditing scope from the tabs:
    * **User Operations**: View operation records of users who have logged in to the platform
    * **System Operations**: View system operation records (operators start with `system:`)

3. Configure query conditions to filter auditing events:

    | Query Condition | Description |
    |----------------|-------------|
    | **Operator** | Username or system account name of the operator (default: `All`) |
    | **Actions** | Type of operation (create, update, delete, manage, rollback, stop, etc., default: `All`) |
    | **Clusters** | Cluster containing the operated resource (default: `All`) |
    | **Resource Type** | Type of the operated resource (default: `All`) |
    | **Resource Name** | Name of the operated resource (supports fuzzy search) |

4. Click **Search**.

:::tip
* Use the **Time Range** dropdown to set the audit time range (default: `Last 30 Minutes`). You can select a preset range or customize one.
* Click the refresh icon to update search results.
* Click the export icon to download results as a `.csv` file.
