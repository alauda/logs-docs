# How to Collect Zookeeper Metrics

::::warning
For security reasons, the Zookeeper metrics port is disabled by default because it exposes an unauthenticated endpoint.  
If you need to collect Zookeeper metrics, follow the steps below to safely enable the exporter.
::::

## Configuration Steps

1. Find the corresponding minfo for your Log Center cluster
    ```bash
    kubectl get minfo | grep logcenter | grep <cluster-name>
    ```

2. Edit the minfo to enable the Zookeeper exporter
    ```bash
    kubectl edit minfo <minfo-name>
    ```

3. In the opened spec, add (or merge) the following configuration:
    ```yaml
    spec:
    valuesOverride:
        ait/chart-alauda-log-center:
        zookeeper:
            exporterEnabled: true
    ```
